# Capstone Study in one Notebook

This notebook is the aggregation of the notebooks:
- Classification, \Classification\Classification.ipynb
- Preparation, \Preparation\PrepareData.ipynb
- Model, \Model\Model.ipynb
- Evaluation, \Evaluation\Evaluation.ipynb

## Additional notes

- CompleteNotebook_featureSet_1 corresponds to \Supplement\genesReferencesFeatureSetsNumbered.xlsx sheet FeatureSet1
- CompleteNotebook_featureSet_2 corresponds to \Supplement\genesReferencesFeatureSetsNumbered.xlsx sheet FeatureSet2
   - To make Logistical Regression work, parameter 'solver' changed to 'newton-cg' from 'lbfgs'
- CompleteNotebook_featureSet_3 corresponds to \Supplement\genesReferencesFeatureSetsNumbered.xlsx sheet FeatureSet3
   - To make Logistical Regression work, parameter 'solver' changed to 'saga' from 'lbfgs'
- CompleteNotebook_featureSet_4 corresponds to \Supplement\genesReferencesFeatureSetsNumbered.xlsx sheet FeatureSet4
- CompleteNotebook_featureSet_5 corresponds to \Supplement\genesReferencesFeatureSetsNumbered.xlsx sheet FeatureSet5

- CompleteNotebook_scaled is the notebook CompleteNotebook, with scaled features

Reviewing the evaluation of the four featuresets, the graphs suggest more data equals less accurate prediction.
