# 4. Implementations of Machine Learning models

***Prerequisite:** Files with selected features named **patient_genes_[variant].csv** must be generated as described in **[Features](../Features)**.*

These notebooks contain the initial setup of the Machine Learning models based on the following algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest

The dataset used is *patient_genes_literature.csv*, though this can easily be swapped with a different feature set.
General data helper functions are declared in the DataHelpers notebook. This includes splitting the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data, as well as functionality for K-fold cross validation and the exporting of various evaluation metrics.

The notebooks for the respective models train the type of model they are named after (as listed above) and use the helper functions to perform the actual data splitting, five-fold cross-validation, and preliminary evaluation.

A summarization of the cross-validation results is displayed at the end of the notebook, and all necessary data is exported to the following files, where *[variant]* refers to the model type trained:

- **model_output_[variant].csv**
- **model_metrics_[variant].csv**

### Next step

Additional evaluations and visualization based on the generated data, including combining those for different models, is generated by the notebook in the **[Evaluation](../Evaluation)** folder, that lives next to this Model folder.
